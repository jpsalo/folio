JP is a usability enthusiast who focuses on optimizing every aspect of product development, from the end user experience to the code architecture.

JP is a programmer since 2010 and specialize in frontend development. He has solid, hands-on experience in product development for the web, backed by CS, HCI and cognitive science studies. JP strives for elegant and future-proof solutions which are both efficient and intuitive to use.

Working at large and small companies and in projects of different scale and age has provided JP insight into team dynamics and business reasoning behind the code.

JP believes that the users of a service can't be an afterthoughtâ€”these people should be at the core of the work. He understands the value of a genuine connection with the users and knows that the best result is achieved when everyone is as close to the people as possible. He enjoys being part of the early-stage prototyping with pen and paper and gets most satisfaction from building complex glitch-free UIs.

JP specializes in User-Centered Design, including:

- Finding out people's need with interviews and observation
- Prototype-oriented design and implementation
- Crafting, conducting and analysing usability studies
- Building interactive systems
