I have been a programmer since 2010 and specialize in frontend development. I have solid, hands-on experience in product development for the web, backed by CS, HCI and cognitive science studies. I strive for elegant and future-proof solutions which are both efficient and intuitive to use.

Working at large and small companies and in projects of different scale and age – past year as a project lead – has provided me insight into team dynamics and business reasoning behind the code. I enjoy being part of the early-stage prototyping with pen and paper, but most satisfaction I get when I finish building e.g. a complex glitch-free mobile-first UI.
