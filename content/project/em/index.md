You can access Extended Mind from all of your devices to instantly manage your notes and tasks. This frees you to do what you do best: connect, create and collaborate.

# What is Extended Mind?

Extended Mind is a minimalist, cross-platform, open source productivity service for note and task management.

How can I use it?

Extended Mind gives you a place to store your private notes and tasks and to instantly access them using any of your devices.

To achieve super fast retrieving, Extended Mind gives tools to easily tag of notes and tasks, and also gives you instant full text search of all of your information.

# Innovativeness

The most unique aspect of Extended Mind is the strong scientific background and respect for human biology and psychology of our team, which guides the development of the service. For the service to become a true extended mind, the time it takes to both retrieve and store information has to be on par with our biological memory. This is why minimalism pervades the entire service: every unnecessary visual element and shiny feature will be removed if it distracts the user from the cognitive task she wants to perform. The service will be built using tools that provide the very best performance with the least amount of code. Extended Mind will always be focused on content and making it as easy and fast as possible to use it.

Another innovative feature of Extended Mind is the folderless storage of items. In Extended Mind every item can be grouped and associated to other items via a network of tags. Extended Mind gives you a set of well thought out categories and keywords that the user can start to use immediately, while still allowing the user the create her own tags.

In addition, the open source implementation of the service is a strong signal to the users that their information will never be exploited. This differentiates Extended Mind from the vast majority of technology startups, and is a good fit for the scientific method and the open access and open data movements.
