Throughout their studies, students may encounter problems in their courses where they need help from their teachers or from their peers but lectures and other contact teaching sessions can be at unsuitable times. Even though many courses have their own communication channels for seeking help, there are situations where the subjective experience of learning is better when done in collaboration with peers. This brings us to the three things needed for successfully studying together: shared location, time and a common subject. In this paper, we study how do we make it easy for students to arrange and participate impromptu study groups and present an application which combines space, time and problem into creating an ad hoc study group. Our testing concentrated on determining the best way for creator to communicate the subject of the group to other students in order to reach and match with as many potential peers as possible. Users were asked to use the application with two different interfaces and messages, and then fill in a survey about their experience. It was found that for the group creator, it is easier to express their problem in their own words, but group participants may find messages with predetermined and more generic subjects easier to understand and thus they are potentially more likely to participate in these study groups.
