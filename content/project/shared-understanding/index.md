Software engineering is inherently social profession and implementing software depends on collaboration between group members. Requirements do not necessarily originate from cutting edge high technology but from customer’s business needs, which brings a new set of problems to be solved—problems that are sociological, not technical. (Whitehead 2007; Fagerholm 2015; Fox, Sillito, & Maurer 2008; DeMarco & Lister 2013, p. 4) Additionally, the goal for many projects is to develop complex systems and design good user experience (UX). Responding to the changed demands for system quality attributes by incorporating design thinking, such as User-Centered Design (UCD), into iterative development is applicable to these circumstances but clear guidelines have not yet surfaced. (Ralph 2015; Fox, Sillito, & Maurer 2008; Kuusinen 2015; Magües, Castro, & Acuña 2016)
