HN Viz is an interactive data visualization project with Hacker News data for discovering interesting stories. The app shows 100 most voted and 100 most commented stories per each year in a bubble chart. Stories are divided into four category types: stories, jobs, projects and questions, and the bubble size is based on how many days was the discussion active. Contextual views show monthly statistics in bar charts, and also metadata of selected story with a link to the original thread on Hacker News. Application is [here](http://hn-viz.herokuapp.com/).
