This is an interactive data visualization project with Hacker News data for discovering interesting stories. It shows 100 most voted and 100 most commented (duplicates removed) stories per each year in a bubble chart. Stories are divided in four category types: stories, jobs, projects (=show) and questions (=ask), and the bubble size is based on how many days was the discussion active. Contextual views show monthly statistics in bar charts, and also metadata of selected story with a link to the original thread in Hacker News. Application is here: hn-viz.herokuapp.com.
